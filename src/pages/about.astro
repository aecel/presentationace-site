    q: "Do you rewrite content?",
    a: "If you want me to, yes. If not, I keep your wording intact and focus on structure, hierarchy, and design polish.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you sign NDAs?",
    a: "Yes. I’m NDA-friendly and treat decks, metrics, and drafts as confidential by default.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you work from rough notes?",
    a: "Absolutely. A rough outline or document is enough to start. I’ll ask only for what’s missing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do you emphasize retainers?",
    a: "Because retainers remove friction. You get reserved capacity, priority turnaround, and a partner who already knows your preferences and brand.",
